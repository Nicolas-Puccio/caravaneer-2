# Caravaneer 2 - Modded

This repository contains a modified version of [Caravaneer 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1500820/Caravaneer_2/)


## Changes

1. **Caravan Members Don't Die**: Caravan members are now immortal and won't die in combat.

2. **Post-Combat Health**: After combat, all caravan members start with at least 10% HP, ensuring good walking speed.

3. **Reduced Warpower**: Each caravan member now contributes less warpower, making your caravan more likely to be attacked, especially if equipped with cheap weapons.

4. **Auto Distribute Ammo & Attack**: Using this button will enable AI control of caravan members. You can only manually control your character.

5. **Increased Starting Stats**: Main character now has 80 stat points to distribute at the start, with each stat capped at 20 points.
